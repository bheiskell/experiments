<div> <h1>Hamming Code</h1> <p> This page generates a Hamming Code given an input ASCII string. This tool is only an educational exercise. </p> <p> Hamming Codes reserve every index which is a power of two (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc) to serve as a boolean checksum for both itself and some of the remaining bits. Each reserved index verifies other indexes which are non-zero when a binary mask is applied. This is the pattern you see below. If a single bit is flipped, the indexes of the incorrect boolean checksums can be summed to find the flipped bit. </p> <p> Note: This implementation does not utilize the zeroth index for two bit flip detection. </p> <label> Input String: <input type="text" ng-model="input" ng-change="onInputChange(input)"> </label> <table> <tr> <th>&nbsp; <th ng-repeat="hammingIndex in hammingIndexes">{{ hammingIndex }}  <tr> <th>Input <td ng-repeat="bit in inputBits track by $index">{{ bit }}  <tr> <th>Encoded <td ng-repeat="bit in encodedBits track by $index">{{ bit }}  <tr> <th>Received <td ng-repeat="receivedBit in receivedBits track by $index"> <input type="button" value="{{receivedBit.bit}}" ng-click="flip($index)" ng-class="{wrong: receivedBit.flipped}">   <tr ng-repeat="powerRow in explodedCalc"> <th>{{ powerRow.powerOfTwo }} <td ng-repeat="receivedBit in powerRow.bits track by $index" ng-class="{ wrong: receivedBit.flipped }">{{ receivedBit.bit }}  </table> <p> <span ng-hide="incorrectIndexes.length === 0"> The incorrect indexes summed: {{ incorrectIndexes.join(' + ') }} = {{ incorrectIndex }} </span> &nbsp; </p> </div>
