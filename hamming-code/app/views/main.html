    <h1>Hamming Code</h1>
    <p>
        This page generates a Hamming Code given an input ASCII string. This
        tool is only an educational exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hamming Codes reserve every index which is a power of two (i.e., 1, 2,
        4, 8, etc) to serve as a boolean checksum for both itself and some of
        the remaining bits. Each reserved index verifies other indexes which
        are non-zero when a binary mask is applied. This is the pattern you
        see below.  If a single bit is flipped, the indexes of the incorrect
        boolean checksums can be summed to find the flipped bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: This implementation does not utilize the zeroth index for two bit
        flip detection.
